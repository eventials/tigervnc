Virtual Network Computing (VNC) is a remote display system which allows you to
view and interact with a virtual desktop environment that is running on another
computer on the network.  Using VNC, you can run graphical applications on a
remote machine and send only the display from these applications to your local
machine.  VNC is platform-independent and supports a wide variety of operating
systems and architectures as both servers and clients.  This package contains a
client which will allow you to connect to a VNC server.

TigerVNC is a high-speed version of VNC based on the RealVNC 4 and X.org code
bases.  TigerVNC started as a next-generation development effort for TightVNC
on Unix and Linux platforms, but it split from its parent project in early 2009
so that TightVNC could focus on Windows platforms.  TigerVNC supports a variant
of Tight encoding that is greatly accelerated by the use of the libjpeg-turbo
JPEG codec.  TigerVNC has replaced RealVNC in the Fedora Project, and there are
long-term plans for it to replace TurboVNC in the VirtualGL Project as well.
