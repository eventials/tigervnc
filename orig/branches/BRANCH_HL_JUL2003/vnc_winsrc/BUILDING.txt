BUILDING vncviewer and WinVNC (TightVNC 1.3dev1 development release)
====================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE: this is a development version and may be unstable.
It's not recommended for production use.

This distibution requires two third-party libraries for successfull
compilation. They are NOT included in this archive. These are are zlib
and JPEG libraries freely available in the source form from following
locations:

  ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz

Please download these libraries prior to compilation. Note that these
archives are in tar+gzip format not very popular in Windows
environments. Here I won't explain how to unpack them, please find
appropriate extractors yourself or unpack them on Unix-like machines.

After you have downloaded and unpacked libraries, place their source
files to the locations listed below, NOT overriding existing files:

  zlib library:
    vnc_winsrc/vncviewer/zlib/
    vnc_winsrc/winvnc/zlib/

  JPEG library:
    vnc_winsrc/vncviewer/libjpeg/
    vnc_winsrc/winvnc/libjpeg/

Compilation has been checked under MS Visual C++ 6.0. Workspace files
(*.dsw) for this environment are included in the distribution. It is
also possible to build TightVNC using "free" Borland C++ 5.5 compiler,
please read BUILDING-bcc32.txt for details.
