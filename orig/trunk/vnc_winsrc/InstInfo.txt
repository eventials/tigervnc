If you're installing TightVNC remotely, working in an active VNC session:

 * Remote upgrade requires rebooting the computer. If you want to be able to
   access your computer after the reboot, please make sure you're running
   current TightVNC version as a service, not in the application mode.

 * There is a number of things that can prevent the machine to reboot correctly,
   and that can cause losing the control over the computer. In other words, there
   is NO WARRANTY that the remote upgrade procedure is absolutely reliable.

 * If you're running WinVNC service from some another VNC distribution, this
   installation procedure won't replace it with the TightVNC service. This is a
   limitation that may be solved in future versions.
