This directory contains some HorizonWimba specific modifications to
the TightVnc winvnc source. It also includes workspace and project
files for our build environment. To use, the entire horizon directory
can be copied over as a subdirectory to vnc_winsrc/winvnc. The 
workspace file AppShare.dsw can then be opened. A few enviroment
variables are necessary for the project to find what it needs and 
some more tinkering is required and detailed under General Issues.

For cursor shape updates, WINVER needs to be set to 0x0500 or greater. 
This is already set in the AppShare.dsp file, but may require a new
sdk to be downloaded from MS. On my Windows 98 box, I've found that
to compile the rc file, I need to use the version of rc.exe that's 
installed by default. Then to compile the rest of the source files, 
I need to register the new sdk environment variables. Because Windows
is awesome, registering and unregistering the new sdk environment
variables should not be done while Visual C is running. Close it, (un)
register variables, then reopen.


General Issues
--------------

The path to the "Executable for Debug Session" will need to be updated
when trying to debug. Also should probably change the working
directory. This should come from the environment variable
APP_SHARE_PATH, but unfortunately, Visual C doesn't seem to understand
environment variables when placed in this setting.



Environment Variables for Build
-------------------------------

APP_SHARE_PATH: Location to place the built AppShare. Also, serves as
the working directory for debugging.

PATH_TO_VNC_1_2: This should be a path to our cvs copy of tightvnc.
This is used for zlib, jpeg, etc. includes. An example path would be:
"relative/liveshare_src/tightvnc/"
