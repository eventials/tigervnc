BUILDING vncviewer and WinVNC (TightVNC 1.3dev4 development release)
====================================================================

IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a development version and may be unstable.
It's not recommended for production use.

This distibution requires third-party libraries for successfull
compilation. They are NOT included in this archive. The required
libraries include zlib and JPEG libraries freely available in the
source form from the following locations:

  ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/libpng/zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz

Please download these libraries prior to compilation. Note that these
archives are in tar+gzip format not very popular in Windows
environments. To unpack the files, either install appropriate
extractors available for Windows platforms, or unpack them on
Unix-like machines.

After you have downloaded and unpacked the libraries, place their
source files to the locations listed below, NOT overriding existing
files:

  zlib library:
    vnc_winsrc/vncviewer/zlib/
    vnc_winsrc/winvnc/zlib/

  JPEG library:
    vnc_winsrc/vncviewer/libjpeg/
    vnc_winsrc/winvnc/libjpeg/

Also, TightVNC compilation requires Microsoft Html Help SDK which can
be freely downloaded from this page:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/htmlhelp/html/hwMicrosoftHTMLHelpDownloads.asp

Only two files from the Html Help SDK are required for compilation,
HtmlHelp.h and HtmlHelp.lib. Copy both files to the following folders:

    vnc_winsrc/vncviewer/
    vnc_winsrc/winvnc/

Compilation has been checked under MS Visual C++ 6.0. Workspace files
(*.dsw) for this environment are included in the distribution. Building
with Borland C++ 5.5 compiler is not supported any more, sorry.
