TightVNC compilation notes for Borland C++ 5.5 users
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: Please read the BUILDING.txt document for information on libraries
required for successful TightVNC compilation.

1. CONFIGURATION

   Make sure the compiler is installed correctly.

   You have to put path to Borland C++ binaries to your PATH environment
   variable (this path is "C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin" by default) and to prepare
   correct configuration files for compiler and linker. Please read the
   document available at

     http://www.objectcentral.com/vide/help/videdoc/bcc32.html

   for more details on correct Borland C++ 5.5 installation. Here are
   example configuration files that were used to build TightVNC for Windows
   95/98 and Windows NT 4.0:

   C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin\bcc32.cfg: =========================================

     -I"C:\Borland\BCC55\Include"
     -L"C:\Borland\BCC55\Lib;C:\Borland\BCC55\Lib\PSDK"
     -DWINVER=0x0400
     -D_WIN32_WINNT=0x0400

   C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin\ilink32.cfg: =======================================

     -L"C:\Borland\BCC55\Lib;c:\Borland\BCC55\Lib\PSDK"

   =========================================================================

2. HTML HELP LIBRARY

   The HtmlHelp.lib object library available in the Html Help SDK is not
   compatible with Borland C++ 5.x tools. To produce compatible library
   file, use a command like this (but locate the hhctrl.ocx file first):

     C:\Borland\BCC55\Bin\implib HtmlHelpB.lib hhctrl.ocx

   Note that you should name the file "HtmlHelpB.lib", unless you want to
   edit the makefiles.

3. BUILDING

   To build TightVNC (both server and viewer) with Borland C++ 5.5, run
   build-bcc32.bat from the top-level directory ("vnc_winsrc"). It will
   create the "binaries" sub-directory and copy three files there:
   vncviewer.exe and two files WinVNC server consist of: winvnc.exe and
   VNCHooks.dll.
