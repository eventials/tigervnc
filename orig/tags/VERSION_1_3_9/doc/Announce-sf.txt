Subject: TightVNC 1.3.9 released

TightVNC is a free remote control package derived from the popular VNC software. With TightVNC, you can see the desktop of a remote machine and control it with your local mouse and keyboard, just like you would do it sitting in the front of that computer.

Version 1.3.9 is the long-awaited new stable release. Since TightVNC 1.2.9 (which was the latest stable version until now), there were many changes, especially in the Windows version: file transfers, support for mirror display driver, major GUI improvements, and a number of bugfixes.
